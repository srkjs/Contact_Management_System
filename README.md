What is a Contact Management System?
          Contact Management system provides powerful tools that enable storage, tracking and management of all the contact information throughout an organization.   
The principle behind constructing a Contact Management System is to effectively retrieve and implement any information that an organization may have on a pre-existing customer. All the information related to a particular customer can be linked and archived only to be retrieved later when they are required most. What should be more noteworthy is the fact that all of this can be arranged over every single terminal and at an affordable cost. Once a company has established a Contact Management System, it can react to the needs of the customer better. The records of the customer can now be studied to understand his or her preferences and implement them for each individual lead. By managing contacts, the organization can also look for opportunities to upsell and cross-sell a product or service depending on the customer’s current situation. On one hand, it establishes a relationship and wins the trust of the customer with consistent assistance. On the other hand, a happy customer can also generate the maximum profits as well as an assured guarantee that he or she will visit the company again sooner or later.

This contact management system is a mini version that resembles an address book. It stores the information such as Name, Address, Phone number and E-mail ID. All these information’s are stored into a file and can be retrieved whenever required.
